# Transfer Learning using Multi-fidelity Data on a Surrogate Convolutional Neural Network for Turbine Wake Modelling

This is the Independent Research Project (IRP) for my Masters of Science (MSc) Applied Computational Science and Engineering (ACSE) course.

- `WakeModel` directory contains the code for this IRP. Execute `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the open-source libraries needed to run the code.

- `docs` directory contains documentation produced from Sphinx, and the source files needed to produce the documentation.

- `report` directory contains the thesis.
